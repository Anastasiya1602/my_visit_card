      <p class="info__description">
        My name is Anastasia Chavdar, I graduated from Tyumen Medical Academy in 2008. I worked as a rheumatologist for 14 years. I really enjoy learning something new and I have many interests. For example, I love playing the drums and I used to play in metal bands. I also enjoy drawing. In my school years, I used to draw many portraits with pencils, and later I started painting with oil, watercolor, and oil pastels. I create jewelry using the technique of tatting and occasionally try my hand at writing music and stories. I used to read a lot, but now I have less time for it. I love learning foreign languages  and currently  I am actively learning Spanish and I have some knowledge of Hebrew. I am in spoken English. I adore movies, especially detective, action, fantasy, and science fiction genres. Of course, I love traveling and exploring the world. I enjoy cycling, ice skating, and playing badminton. I have also started learning programming, and this website serves as my mini portfolio to share my work and tell about myself. I would appreciate your feedback, messages, and perhaps even orders! Wishing everyone peace!
